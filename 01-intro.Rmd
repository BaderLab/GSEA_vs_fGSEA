# Comparing GSEA and fGSEA {#intro}

Do you want to run the pathways and network analysis from R instead of doing everything mannually?

GSEA is a java application that can be run through their GUI or through the command line but is dependant on a java installation.  There is no recent implementation of GSEA in R although there are many packages that perform similiar analysis.  

Compare enrichment results from the GSEA java application and fast running R package fGSEA.


We are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this Workshop R Notebooks book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
