# CBW Workshop example R Notebooks {#intro}

Do you want to run the pathways and network analysis from R instead of doing everything mannually as demonstrated in the workshop?

Everything (almost!) that was discussed in the lectures and practicals can be done computationally through R.


We are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this Workshop R Notebooks book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
