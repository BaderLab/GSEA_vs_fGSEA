Everything (almost!) that was discussed in the lectures and practicals can be done computationally through R. We are using the bookdown package (Xie 2023) in this Workshop R Notebooks book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "],["setup.html", "Chapter 3 Setup 3.1 Install R and RStudio 3.2 Docker [Optional] 3.3 Install Docker", " Chapter 3 Setup 3.1 Install R and RStudio As with many open source projects, R is a constantly evolving language with regular updates. There is a major release once a year with patch releases through out the year. Often scripts and packages will work from one release to the next (ignoring pesky warnings that a package was compiled on a previous version of R is common) but there are exceptions. Some newer packages will only work on the latest version of R so sometimes the choice of upgrading or not using a new package might present themselves. Often, the amount of packages and work that is need to upgrade is not realized until the process has begun. This is where docker demonstrates it most valuable features. You can create a new instance based on the latest release of R and all your needed packages without having to change any of your current settings. In order to use these notebooks supplied here you need to have: R installed on your computer and a list of packages. (including BiocManager, BiomaRt, gprofiler2, GSA) Each notebook in this set will check for the required packages and install them if they are missing so at the base level you need to just have R installed. There are many different ways you can use and setup R. By simply installing R you can use it directly but it is highly recommended that you also install and use RStudio which is an Integrate development environment (IDE) for R. You cannot just download RStudio and use it. It requires an installation of R. You don’t need to install R and RStudio though. You can also use R and RStudio through docker. I highly recommend using docker instead 3.2 Docker [Optional] Changing versions and environments are a continuing struggle with bioinformatics pipelines and computational pipelines in general. An analysis written and performed a year ago might not run or produce the same results when it is run today. Recording package and system versions or not updating certain packages rarely work in the long run. One the best solutions to reproducibility issues is containing your workflow or pipeline in its own coding environment where everything from the operating system, programs and packages are defined and can be built from a set of given instructions. There are many systems that offer this type of control including: Docker. Singularity “A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.” (“What Is a Container?” n.d.) Why are containers great for Bioiformatics? allows you to create environments to run bioinformatis pipelines. create a consistent environment to use for your pipelines. test modifications to the pipeline without disrupting your current set up. Coming back to an analysis years later and there is no need to install older versions of packages or programming languages. Simply create a container and re-run. 3.3 Install Docker Download and install docker desktop. Follow slightly different instructions for Windows or MacOS/Linux 3.3.1 Windows it might prompt you to install additional updates (for example - https://docs.Microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package) and require multiple restarts of your system or docker. launch docker desktop app. Open windows Power shell navigate to directory on your system where you plan on keeping all your code. For example: C:\\USERS\\risserlin\\cbw_workshop_code Run the following command: (the only difference with the windows command is the way the current directory is written. ${PWD} instead of \"$(pwd)\") docker run -e PASSWORD=changeit --rm \\ -v ${PWD}:/home/rstudio/projects -p 8787:8787 \\ risserlin/workshop_base_image Windows defender firewall might pop up with warning. Click on Allow access. In docker desktop you see all containers you are running and easily manage them. 3.3.2 MacOS / Linux Open Terminal navigate to directory on your system where you plan on keeping all your code. For example: /Users/risserlin/bcb420_code Run the following command: (the only difference with the windows command is the way the current directory is written. ${PWD} instead of \"$(pwd)\") docker run -e PASSWORD=changeit --rm \\ -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;:/home/rstudio/projects -p 8787:8787 \\ --add-host &quot;localhost:My.IP.address&quot; risserlin/workshop_base_image References "],["run-gprofiler-from-r.html", "Chapter 4 Run g:profiler from R 4.1 Initialize variables and libraries 4.2 Load in Query set 4.3 Run g:profiler with supplied genesets 4.4 Download and load g:profiler geneset file 4.5 Filter results by geneset size 4.6 Create an output file of the results - Generic enrichment Map file from g:profiler gmt 4.7 Run g:profiler with your own genesets (example using BaderLab genesets) 4.8 Download and load Bader lab geneset file 4.9 Filter Bader lab geneset file 4.10 Upload the gmt files to gprofiler 4.11 Create an output file of the results - Generic enrichment Map file from Baderlab gmt", " Chapter 4 Run g:profiler from R 4.1 Initialize variables and libraries Detailed instructions on how to run g:Profiler programmatically from R The parameters are set manually here but if you want to run the script from the command line then you can update the notebook to pull the parameters from the command line given arguments by updating each variable below to pull the values from the paramters - for example: variable &lt;- params$parameter_name For more details see - defining and using parameters and Knitting with parameters #where to put all the generated files working_dir &lt;- &quot;./generated_data/g_profiler&quot; # where to find the data files needed to run the analysis data_dir &lt;- &quot;./data&quot; # File name containing the list of genes to be used for analysis genelist_file &lt;- &quot;Supplementary_Table1_Cancer_drivers.txt&quot; # default max size of the genesets for example - 250.

The most common reasons for supplying your own genesets is the ability to use up to date annotations or in-house annotations that might not be available in the public sphere yet. One of the greatest features of g:Profiler is that it is updated on a regular basis and most of the previous versions are available online ont the gprofiler archive. The gprofielr2 -g:Profiler R implementation is a wrapper for the web version. You require an internet connection to get enrichment results. 4.3 Run g:profiler with supplied genesets For detailed descriptions of all the parameters that can be specified for the gost g:profiler function see -here For this query we are specifying - query - the set of genes of interest, as loaded in from the Supplementary_Table1_Cancer_drivers.txt file. significant - set to FALSE because we want g:Profiler to return all the results not just the ones that it deems significant by its perdetermined threshold. ordered_query - set to TRUE because for this set of genes they are ordered in order of their significance correction_method - set to fdr. by default g:Profiler uses g:Scs organism - set to “hsapiens” for homo sapiens. Organism names are constructed by concatenating the first letter of the name and the family name (according to gprofiler2 documentation) source - the geneset source databases to use for the analysis. We recommend using GO biological process (GO:BP), WikiPathways (WP) and Reactome (Reac) but there are additional sources you can add (GO molecular function or cellular component(GO:MF, GO:CC), KEGG, transcription factors (TF), microRNA targets (MIRNA), corum complexes (CORUM), Human protein atlas (HPA),Human phenotype ontology (HP) ) gprofiler_results &lt;- gost(query = query_set , significant=FALSE, ordered_query = TRUE, exclude_iea=FALSE, correction_method = &quot;fdr&quot;, organism = organism, source = c(&quot;REAC&quot;,&quot;WP&quot;,&quot;GO:BP&quot;)) #get the gprofiler results table enrichment_results &lt;- gprofiler_results$result enrichment_results[1:5,] ## query significant p_value term_size query_size intersection_size ## 1 query_1 TRUE 9.272751e-39 5493 121 103 ## 2 query_1 TRUE 1.694623e-36 5836 121 103 ## 3 query_1 TRUE 1.276992e-35 5662 121 101 ## 4 query_1 TRUE 4.128404e-35 2976 121 79 ## 5 query_1 TRUE 1.198524e-34 3131 121 80 ## precision recall term_id source ## 1 0.8512397 0.01875114 GO:0031323 GO:BP ## 2 0.8512397 0.01764907 GO:0080090 GO:BP ## 3 0.8347107 0.01783822 GO:0051171 GO:BP ## 4 0.6528926 0.02654570 GO:0031325 GO:BP ## 5 0.6611570 0.02555094 GO:0051173 GO:BP ## term_name ## 1 regulation of cellular metabolic process ## 2 regulation of primary metabolic process ## 3 regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process ## 4 positive regulation of cellular metabolic process ## 5 positive regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process ## effective_domain_size source_order ## 1 21110 7510 ## 2 21110 18790 ## 3 21110 14316 ## 4 21110 7512 ## 5 21110 14318 ## parents ## 1 GO:0019222, GO:0044237, GO:0050794 ## 2 GO:0019222, GO:0044238 ## 3 GO:0006807, GO:0019222 ## 4 GO:0009893, GO:0031323, GO:0044237, GO:0048522 ## 5 GO:0006807, GO:0009893, GO:0051171 4.4 Download and load g:profiler geneset file In order to create a proper Generic enrichment results file we will need a copy of the gmt file used by g:Profiler. (also to create an Enrichment map). Download the gmt file used for this analysis from g:profiler #the link to the gmt file is static no matter what version gprofiler_gmt_url &lt;- &quot;https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/static/gprofiler_full_hsapiens.name.gmt&quot; #get version info gprofiler as the gmt file is always associated with # a specific version of g:profiler gprofiler_version &lt;- get_version_info(organism=organism) gprofiler_gmt_filename &lt;- file.path(working_dir, paste(&quot;gprofiler_full&quot;, organism, gprofiler_version$gprofiler_version,sep=&quot;_&quot;, &quot;.name.gmt&quot;)) if(!file.exists(gprofiler_gmt_filename)){ download.file(url = gprofiler_gmt_url, destfile = gprofiler_gmt_filename) } To create a proper Generic enrichmentMap results file we need to include the list of genes that are associated with each geneset. To do that we need to know what genes are associated with each set and filter them by our query set. Load in the geneset definitions from the gmt file we just downloaded from g:profiler site. #load in the g:profiler geneset file capt_output &lt;- capture.output(genesets_gprofiler &lt;- GSA.read.gmt( filename = gprofiler_gmt_filename)) names(genesets_gprofiler$genesets) &lt;- genesets_gprofiler$geneset.names For the next module the name of the gmt file is - gprofiler_full_hsapiens.name.gmt but it is important to preserve the database version so in the future when we revisit these results for publication or results verfication we have the exact version used. Instead of creating a copy of the file (which can be pretty large) create a symbolic link to the file with the generic name. #file.exists does not work for a symbolic link on my computer for some reason # list the files in the directory and check if the symbolic link is there #if(file.exists(file.path(working_dir, &quot;gprofiler_full_hsapiens.name.gmt&quot;))){ if(length(grep(x = list.files(file.path(working_dir)), pattern = &quot;gprofiler_full_hsapiens.name.gmt&quot;, fixed = TRUE) &gt; 0 )){ file.remove(file.path(working_dir, &quot;gprofiler_full_hsapiens.name.gmt&quot;)) } ## [1] TRUE file.symlink( gprofiler_gmt_filename,file.path(working_dir, &quot;gprofiler_full_hsapiens.name.gmt&quot;)) ## [1] TRUE # Given: # query_genes - genes used for enrichment analysis (or as query) # # returns - the genes that overlap with the query set and part of the given # genesets getGenesetGenes &lt;- function(query_genes, subset_genesets){ genes &lt;- lapply(subset_genesets,FUN=function(x){intersect(x,query_genes)}) # For each of the genes collapse to the comma separate text genes_collapsed &lt;- unlist(lapply(genes,FUN=function(x){ paste(x,collapse = &quot;,&quot;)})) genes_collapsed_df &lt;- data.frame(term_id = names(genes), genes = genes_collapsed,stringsAsFactors = FALSE) return(genes_collapsed_df) } 4.5 Filter results by geneset size Filter the table to include just the columns that are required for the generic enrichment map file results GEM. Restrict the results to just the ones that have at least min_gs_size and less than max_gs_size terms and min_intersection size include only the term_id, term_name, p_value (and p_value again because the p_value is actually the corrected p-value. The output file does not contain the nominal p_value. For down stream analysis though it is expected to have both a p-value and a q-value so just duplicate the q-value as both p-value and q-value) Vary the thresholds for max_gs_size just as we did in Module 2 lab - min_gs_size = 3 max_gs_size = 10000 max_gs_size = 1000 max_gs_size = 250 # filer by params defined above # by default we have set the max and min gs size to 250 and 3, respectively. enrichment_results_mxgssize_250_min_3 &lt;- subset(enrichment_results,term_size &gt;= min_gs_size &amp; term_size &lt;= max_gs_size &amp; intersection_size &gt;= min_intersection , select = c(term_id,term_name,p_value,p_value )) enrichment_results_mxgssize_1000_min_3 &lt;- subset(enrichment_results,term_size &gt;= min_gs_size &amp; term_size &lt;= 1000 &amp; intersection_size &gt;= min_intersection , select = c(term_id,term_name,p_value,p_value )) enrichment_results_mxgssize_10000_min_3 &lt;- subset(enrichment_results,term_size &gt;= min_gs_size &amp; term_size &lt;= 10000 &amp; intersection_size &gt;= min_intersection , select = c(term_id,term_name,p_value,p_value )) 4.6 Create an output file of the results - Generic enrichment Map file from g:profiler gmt The file requires - name description p-value q-value phenotyp list of genes (overlap of query set and original geneset) The list of genes needs to be calculated using the gmt file and original query set. For each geneset found in the result find the overlap between the set of genes that are a part of the geneset and the query set. # Given: # gprofiler_results - results form g_profiler R function (filtered by desired) # parameters # gs - genes associated with each geneset, loaded in from a gmt file. # # returns - the properly formatted GEM file results # createGEMformat &lt;- function(results, gs, query_genes){ if(nrow(results) &gt;0){ #add phenotype to the results formatted_results &lt;- cbind(results,1) # Add the genes to the genesets subset_genesets &lt;- gs$genesets[ which(gs$geneset.names %in% results$term_id)] genes &lt;- getGenesetGenes(query_genes, subset_genesets) formatted_results &lt;- merge(formatted_results,genes,by.x=1, by.y=1) colnames(formatted_results) &lt;- c(&quot;name&quot;,&quot;description&quot;,&quot;p-value&quot;, &quot;q-value&quot;,&quot;phenotype&quot;,&quot;genes&quot;) } return(formatted_results) } enrichment_results_mxgssize_10000_min_3_GEMfile &lt;- createGEMformat( enrichment_results_mxgssize_10000_min_3, genesets_gprofiler, query_set) enrichment_results_mxgssize_1000_min_3_GEMfile &lt;- createGEMformat( enrichment_results_mxgssize_1000_min_3, genesets_gprofiler, query_set) enrichment_results_mxgssize_250_min_3_GEMfile &lt;- createGEMformat( enrichment_results_mxgssize_250_min_3, genesets_gprofiler, query_set) Output each of the above filtered files #output the enrichment map file write.table(enrichment_results_mxgssize_10000_min_3_GEMfile, file = file.path(working_dir, &quot;gProfiler_hsapiens_lab2_results_GEM_maxterm10000.txt&quot;), row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE, quote = FALSE) #output the enrichment map file write.table(enrichment_results_mxgssize_1000_min_3_GEMfile, file = file.path(working_dir, &quot;gProfiler_hsapiens_lab2_results_GEM_maxterm1000.txt&quot;), row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE, quote = FALSE) #output the enrichment map file write.table(enrichment_results_mxgssize_250_min_3_GEMfile, file = file.path(working_dir, &quot;gProfiler_hsapiens_lab2_results_GEM_maxterm250.txt&quot;), row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE, quote = FALSE) 4.7 Run g:profiler with your own genesets (example using BaderLab genesets) 4.8 Download and load Bader lab geneset file Download the latest Bader lab genesets gmt_url = &quot;http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/current_release/Human/symbol/&quot; #list all the files on the server filenames = RCurl::getURL(gmt_url) tc = textConnection(filenames) contents = readLines(tc) close(tc) #get the gmt that has all the pathways and does not include # terms inferred from electronic annotations(IEA) #start with gmt file that has pathways only rx = gregexpr(&quot;(?&lt;=&lt;a href=\\&quot;)(.*.GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea.*.)(.gmt)(?=\\&quot;&gt;)&quot;, contents, perl = TRUE) gmt_file = unlist(regmatches(contents, rx)) dest_gmt_file &lt;- file.path(working_dir,gmt_file) if(!file.exists(dest_gmt_file)){ download.file( paste(gmt_url,gmt_file,sep=&quot;&quot;), destfile=dest_gmt_file ) } In order to use our results down stream in the Enrichment map we need to generate results files that we can pass to Enrichment Map. Load in the GMT file 4.9 Filter Bader lab geneset file The g:Profiler interface only allows for filtering genesets by size only after the analysis is complete. After the analysis is complete means the filtering is happening after Multiple hypothesis testing. Filtering prior to the analysis will generate more robust results because we exclude the uninformative large genesets prior to testing changing the sets that multiple hypothesis filtering will get rid of.

It can be easily run through its integrated user interface. To make this a seemless pipeline we can run GSEA from the command line with a set of options. Any of the supplied options can be customized and there are many additional options that can be specified.

In GSEA interface this is set to 500 but we prefer to use a more stringent setting of 200. set_min - minimum size for individual gene sets zip_report - true/false to zip output directory out - directory where to place the result directory. if(run_gsea){ command &lt;- paste(&quot;&quot;,gsea_jar, &quot;GSEAPreRanked -gmx&quot;, dest_gmt_file, &quot;-rnk&quot; ,file.path(working_dir,rnk_file), &quot;-collapse false -nperm 1000 -scoring_scheme weighted&quot;, &quot;-rpt_label &quot;,analysis_name, &quot; -plot_top_x 20 -rnd_seed 12345 -set_max 200&quot;, &quot; -set_min 15 -zip_report false &quot;, &quot; -out&quot; ,working_dir, &quot; &gt; gsea_output.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;) system(command) } References "],["create-gmt-file-from-ensembl.html", "Chapter 6 Create GMT file from Ensembl 6.1 Load Libraries 6.2 Set up Biomart connection 6.3 Get species GO annotations 6.4 Format results into GMT file", " Chapter 6 Create GMT file from Ensembl The Baderlab geneset download site is an updated resource for geneset files from GO, Reactome, WikiPathways, Pathbank, NetPath, HumanCyc, IOB, … many others that can be used in g:Profiler or GSEA and many other enrichment tools that support the gmt format.
